# Solvei
Solvei is a platform dedicated to helping CSEDU students by providing a searchable archive of past exam questions. Users can search for questions by year, course code, or instructor, making it easier to find relevant materials for their studies. Additionally, students can contribute by posting answers or leaving comments on specific questions. The backend is hosted on Render, while the frontend is deployed on Vercel. The project was developed using React.js for the frontend, Express.js for the backend, and JavaScript as the primary programming language. The design was implemented using basic CSS as a personal challenge.
